## citypersons.py

This file contains all the necessary code to load in instance of the citypersons dataset onto the current training cycle. It also contains
all the code necessary to run my chosen augmentations. These augmentations are triggered by command line arguments that the user can run
when they call the training file in ../tools. Augmentations will not run if the user is running a training instance.
