# Data Augmentation for Convolutional Neural Networks on Pedestrian Detection

#### School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a deep learning architecture that can be used for pedestrian detection on images. Data augmentation is the process of artificially expanding a dataset to diversify the features of its desired classifications. In this study, I will test the effects of traditional data augmentation on a pedestrian detection dataset called CityPersons, using a popular CNN called Faster R-CNN. I wrote code to clean CityPersons and load it onto training for Faster R-CNN, along with code for my chosen data augmentations. I will explore how the different data augmentations on the training data affect the accuracy of the model when tested on unseen data. I observed an increase in certain key accuracy metrics despite running into issues with computing power and diversity of augmentation types.

The code for this project is contained in this repository. All files were originally created in Jupyter Lab, then pushed onto this repository. They were then pulled onto the University GPU server and training was run on that system. Any bug fixes and edits would occur on GitHub, then be pulled again onto the GPU.
